This holds an old version of this repository which used to be a repo for nushell code prior to real commits that I started making into the codebase
in December 2020.  Keep this fork lying around through the end of 2021 and then it can be blown away.  By then nushell will be far ahead of this
legacy code.  In fact, this repo has no use except for a review of where things used to be at in the past.
